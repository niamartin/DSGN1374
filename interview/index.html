	<div class="q"> Question 3 </div>
	<p class="quest"> What is the first thing you notice when you look at a website?
	<p class="answer">
		M: Pictures - although depending on the content or the website they can be distracting and draw my attention away from what I mean to look at!
				<br>
				<br>
				L: Photos - I like them on certain websites! If used correctly they can explain hard information in a visual way. For me this is ideal when looking at research or science information.

	<div class="q"> Question 4 </div>
	<p class="quest"> What do you like about websites? 
  <p class="answer">

				<br>
				<br>

<div class="box"> 
	<div class="q"> Question 5 </div>
	<p class="quest"> What don't you like about websites? 
  <p class="answer">
  		M: Frames and Borders - I dont dislike them. They can be okay but they must have a reason to be there and they must  be layout properly other wise they can look messy and even cause distractions. As well as ads, subscriptions and pop up boxes.
				<br>
				<br>
				L: Certain Cartoons or Animations - Ads, pop ups and subcription notifications are probably the most annyoing for anyone but I would say the think I dislike the most is cartoon like drawings or animations. Not all websites have these of course and thats not to say all are bad but when looking at a website there are sometimes drawings or animations that are not relevant to the content I'm searching for. Any sometimes they are very large on the website, which makes me wonder what they are there for.

<div class="box"> 
	<div class="q"> Question 6 </div>
	<p class="quest"> What is somethings you like / dislike about design?
  <p class="answer">
  		M: Fonts - I noticed with my eyes anyway that certain font can be hard to read. Script fonts in particular. I like designs that have symmetry. I also dislike disappearing images, especiallly if they move to fast.
				<br>
				<br>
				L: Colour - Vibrant colours can be very distracting on a website, however if used in a proper way it can capture your eyes on an important topic. As I said before, "there has to be a balance in order for me to return".

<div class="box"> 
	<div class="q"> Question 7 </div>

<p class="quest"> If the web was not available to you how would you feel? 
  <p class="answer">
  		M: It saves time. You have information at your fingertips and multiple resorces 
				<br>
				<br>
				L: We have become so dependant on the internet that we would be lost in a way without it. We would have to go back to using libraries.
