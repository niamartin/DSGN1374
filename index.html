      Using the provided text, recreate the word-processor document in HTML. Select the appropriate elements for each piece of text in an effort to give the various pieces of content semantic meaning and contextual hierarchy. Do not use any style properties or attributes.

    <td valign="top">
      <span class="tabletext">
      Make a copy of your unstyled document from the previous exercise. Create an external stylesheet and link it in the head of your HTML file. Add styles to your webpage to give it new form. Consider how it can become more visually engaging and what new systems or relationships of typographic hierarchy and contrast can be established.
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      <span class="tabletext">
      Use HTML and CSS to create a webpage that explores typographic transformation and experimentation. Consider the possibilities of typography as: image, shape, pattern, object, landscape. Avoid using lines and shapes.
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      <span class="tabletext">
    Create a webpage to display a collection of your own images. These can come from a social media account or elsewhere, but they should be meaningful to you. Consider the possibilities of how you can display your collection and how a visitor of the page might move through, or be led through the content. Include any other text or assets that are relevant to creating this experience.

    <td valign="top">
      <span class="tabletext">
      Conduct an interview with one of your classmates and create a webpage to document it. You will need a recording of the entire interview—you might take notes and/or record the audio or a video—to be transcribed as content for your webpage. Consider the ways in which the material can be presented, the ways that these different modes of presentation can be structured, and the experience of the user.
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      <span class="tabletext">
      Select at least two of the class readings and create a webpage as a reading response for each. The responses can include content that you: write, draw, photograph, film, find, etc. You are not summarizing the readings, you are responding and reacting to them through both the content of your responses and the design decisions made therein. As such, no two responses should be exactly alike. In addition to each of your reading response documents, create an index page that links to each response.
