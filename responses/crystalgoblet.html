Personally I would like to think I know a bit about wine and the taste is important, but I also enjoy seeing the wine through a glass. In the instance of this metaphor however I wouldn't know which to choose the goblet or the glass.  When reading this article there was many interesting ways typography or the printing of a piece can be compared to that of a "everyday" object like a glass.

 <h5> Quote </h5>
	<br>
	<br>

	"Printing demands a humility of mind, for the lack of which many of the fine arts are even
now floundering in self-conscious and maudlin experiments. There is nothing simple or dull
in achieving the transparent page. "
